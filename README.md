## News Search

#### Overview
Application Features. 
1. **Enable Service:** I have a service written in backend that a user can enable and disable using a REST endpoint. This service calls an external news API and saves the data to mongodb document store. 
1. **Fetch News From Database:** Another API provides functionality to fetch news from the mongodb database and display it in the UI. 
1. **Fetch News On Author**: There is also an API to fetch News based on author name, however, this can't be called through UI. One can however call it through the browser at  https:/host:port/author/{authorname}
1. **UI:** UI part is made in angular, and has functions to toggle the service (start stop service). The second part displays the documents stored in mongodb in the UI. The UI filters the repeated news Item through an object map called newsMapper available in NewsBoxComponent.   


## Points
#### Thought process: 
For this project, it was important to decide and build a backend before the client side. The reason for this is deciding on database storage, APIs and services make it clearer to implement the client side logic.
 
 While initially I had decided to use elastic search, it's TransactionClient in spring wasn't consistent with the version of elasticsearch I installed. Now I'm using mongodb to store the information. 

I have used the inbuilt Spring Repository to query documents from mongodb and sorting is done in the UI itself through a class.

**How am I sorting redundant data?** 
As I had the option to sort through redundant data either in database or in UI, I choose the latter. I'm using a class called newsMapper to do so. This object is a keyvalue pair, where key is the unique id used to identify individual news. A news that is repeated will have same keys. The repeated news I am storing as array of object inside the first News object. The array name is childs.

#### Limitations:
1. The UI loads the data on the main thread, and for huge number of data will definitely hang the UI. Solution is to populated the view in a background thread. 
1. The status displayed may be incorrect ifone loads the view after toggling the service. Solution: Call the API and get status at the start of the view load.
1. Instead of printing the error in console, it's a good practice to log all the errors through a logging framework such as Log4j. This can be done by configuring the log4j in application.properties and using the Log4j class to log data into a file.


## How to Setup Project: 
1. Import all java dependencies through maven. 
1. Go to src/ui/my-sassy-app and install all Javascript/typescript dependency using node package manager. `npm install`
1. Need to have mongodb database installed. Start mongodb service using. `sudo service mongod start`

## Part 2: Continuous Integration | Deployment Steps:

**Need:** CICD means continuous integration and deployment. Itâ€™s a pipleline for a code to be delivered to the client, quickly and safely.

1. **Commit To central Repo:**   CICD involves committing a code to a central repository. This ensures that all changes are available at one place, simplifying process of code tests and build. Tests such as unit tests, Data Driven Testing and code linting is done for quality assurance.
1. **Code Scans:** In this process, a centralized code scan and tests are run. Through afformentioned tests, the code is tested. If the code fails here, then the tester is notified using a issue tracking software such as JIRA>
1. **Generate Builds and Test Reports**: After code scans are completed and the code passess code standard, builds are created. This is done by systems such as jenkins. These are jar files (differential or complete jars) that need to be shipped to the client site. Jars can also be created based on the type of main branch in the repo (development builds, master builds, production builds).The results of test cases and builds are also generated in this process and stored centrally. This notifies the developer of warnings, errors in the code, which can be improved upon. 
1. **Automate Deployment:** Once the build is created, there are few scenarios. 1. Client server deployment of jar. 2. Cloud Deployment (like Heroku etc). In case,of this scenario, we can make the jars available to the client for deployment either manually or automatically. For the second scenario, we can setup a deployment pipeline to automatically ship the jars to the cloud. 

## NoSQL Database Brief Intro:
1. Store data as Documents (json structure)
1. Ease for horizontal scaling
1. No specific schema to adhere to, avoid nulls
1. Highly available system
1. Not a replacement for RDBMS - solves different use cases (big data, flexible schema, availablity issue etc)
